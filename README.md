# Zillow-Rental-Search
Python app that scraps the Zillow website and generates a spreadsheet with a list of potential rentals.

We are looking at renting a home in San Francisco with a price lower than 3k/month and with at least one bedroom.

We use Beautiful Soup we are going to scrape to all of this (Zillow).
We want the price, the address and the URL the card of the listing will link .

After the scrapping we are going to use Selenium on a Google Form, to autofill it with the price, address and link.
One form per listing, once all the responses from the forms are compiled, we will convert them into a spreadsheet.
